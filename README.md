## Causal Machine Learning
Impact evaluation methods such as Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), A/B testing, and Difference-in-Differences are powerful tools for causal inference, but they are not designed for prediction. Machine learning methods like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks excel at prediction but fall short of providing causal insights.
